Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

ðŸ“ŒProblem Statement
Diabetes mellitus is one of the chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause
many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the worldâ€™s
diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which suggests that one among the ten adults in the
future is suffering from diabetes. The tedious identifying process leads to visiting of a patient
to a diagnostic center and consulting doctor. But the research in machine learning approaches
solves this critical problem. The motive of this project is to design a model which can predict
the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy. Therefore different machine
learning classification algorithms like Decision Tree, KNN and Naive Bayes etc. can be
used in this process to detect diabetes at an early stage.Ensemble Learning techniques helps
to improve the accuracy of prediction.

ðŸ“ŒScope
1. This system can be used in Hospitals for Diabetes Prediction at an early stage.
2. This can be also used for generating machine learning dataset.
3. In Pathology labs for Diabetes Prediction.
4. Useful for small clinics in rural areas.


ðŸ“ŒObjective
1. To predict whether the person suffers from Diabetes or not.
2. To simplify the process of Diabetes detection using Machine Learning.
3. To evaluate the performance of different algorithms used for prediction.
4. To create a standard model for diabetes prediction.
5. To enhance model accuracy using Ensemble Learning techniques.
